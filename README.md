# Blood Bank Application

This is a **MERN Stack** project that simulates a Blood Bank management system. The application is divided into two main parts: **Donor** and **Hospital**. Donors can register and provide their information, while hospitals can search for registered donors based on blood group, location, and other criteria.

  - Donor registration and login.
  - Donor can update their profile information.
  - Once available, the donor provides details like blood group, address, and contact information.

- **Hospital Section:**

  - Search functionality to filter donors based on blood group, location, etc.
